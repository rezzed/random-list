# random-list

This is the source repository of https://rezzed.github.io/random-list/  

The purpose of this page is to create a simple list that can be randomised and 
shared via URL without sending any private data to a server.

> :warning: Do not use the page if you need _real_ randomness.

## Why does the page exist?

I just needed this kind of functionality and wanted to try the used technology stack.
